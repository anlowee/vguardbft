When you click the marker of a viechle, you can see the detail information of the viechle at the bottom of the page, including:
- Truck number: the index of the truck.
- Cargo type: the type of the cargo the truck is carrying.
- Cargo amount: the amount of the cargo the truck is carrying.
- From: the location where the truck is from.
- To: the location where the truck is going to.
- Progress: the progress of the truck's route.
- Is booked: whether the truck is booked for the next shippment.

This can help the participants to know better the location of the truck and the progress of the truck's route.
